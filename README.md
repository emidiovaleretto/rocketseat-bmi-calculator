## Description

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator project implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The calculator takes user input for weight and height and calculates the BMI based on the provided values. It then displays the calculated BMI along with a corresponding category, indicating the user's body weight status.

## Features

- Calculate BMI: Users can input their weight and height in metric units (kilograms and meters) and calculate their BMI.
- Display Results: The calculator provides the calculated BMI value.
- Error Handling: If the user fails to enter data for weight or height, an error toast notification is displayed in the top right corner of the screen, indicating that all fields must be filled.
